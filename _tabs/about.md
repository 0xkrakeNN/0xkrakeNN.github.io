Hi, I’m **Mohammed Ihssane** AKA **0xkrakeNN** — a cybersecurity enthusiast with a strong interest in **penetration testing** and ethical hacking.

This blog serves as a personal space to:

-  Track my learning journey
-  Share technical notes and cheat sheets
-  Publish walkthroughs of Hack The Box (HTB) machines
-  Document experiments and techniques I’ve tried

I'm currently preparing for the **Certified Penetration Testing Specialist (CPTS)** certification by Hack The Box Academy. Through this blog, I aim to consolidate what I learn and hopefully help others on the same path.

Thanks for stopping by!
